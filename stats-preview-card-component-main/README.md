## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned
During the course of this project,  I was able to learn and try out some cool html and css properties which I haven't tried before:
-I was able to manipulate the color of an image
-I was also able to learn abit about media queries.

 Here are some code samples of areas I would love to highlight to reinforce my  knowledge.



```css
.bdy .img{
        width: 86.5%;
        height: 3vh;
        background-position: center;
        background-size: cover;
        position: relative;
        left: 55%;
        top: 0%;
    }
    .bdy .img::before{
        content: '';
        position: absolute;
        height: 70vh;
        width: 70%;
        background:hsla(277, 84%, 27%, 0.5) 
      }



### Continued development

There are some areas that I would want to continue focusing on in future projects. Some concepts I'm still not completely comfortable with and find useful that I would love to refine and perfect are the css media queries and the css flexbox.

### Useful resources

- (https://youtu.be/69IbzTWg5PM?si=RWgtGTm7ULuflMit) - This helped me to understand media queries abit . I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
